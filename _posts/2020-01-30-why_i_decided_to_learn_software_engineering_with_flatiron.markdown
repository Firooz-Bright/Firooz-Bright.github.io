When I was a kid I always liked to know about engineering and electronics. During the college back home in Iran I went to the great school for electrical and computer engineering. I was enjoying problem solving specifically when I was solving the Physics and Mathematical problem it was so rapturous and enjoyable for me. While I was in college I liked to program the small electronic gates and then Micro-controllers, so after I was able to make funny robots and other electronic device that can be connected to the computer. I can remember I had a thermodynamic system for cooling and the idea was patented back home in Iran and I got some rewards even in International innovation fairs in Europe. When I came to the USA as refugee I tried to get back on the right path of my education again and unfortunately the high cost of living in Bay Area never allowed me to be relax even one day, however I started school again and working concomitantly hard to afford living here, but I felt I am so exhausted and I need to do something different. So to be honest with myself, I got tired of costly education system in the USA and dropped my school and  I want to be software-engineer only to afford living here, and have at least middle class quality of life. I decided to join the Flatiron school (Part-time), because I couldn't risk quitting the job that pays my bills.Â
